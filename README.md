## The COVID-19 Impact on NYC Crime

### Joy Moglia, Hanan Sukenik, Reese Hamilton

New York City was an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States. From March to May in
2020, approximately 203,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported with a 9.2% overall
fatality rate and a 32.1% fatality rate among hospitalized patients1. As of March 15, 2020, there
were 30,000 confirmed deaths in New York City and 626,400 lost jobs, with private sector
employment falling 15%2. Unemployment has left many residents struggling to pay rent, buy
food and cover medical bills. The city also witnessed widespread social unrest, sparked by the
killing of George Flloyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Pandemics have the potential to increase the risk of crime. Prior research on pandemics found
that isolation from quarantine can result in mental distress, loneliness, depression, PTSD,
anger, sleep disorders and substance abuse, all factors that increase the risk of violence3.
Research has also shown that rising unemployment can lead to an increase in property crimes4.
This project seeks to investigate the impact of the pandemic on crime in New York City by
analyzing NYPD crime data.

Our research will investigate the following hypotheses:
1. We expect overall crime to decline in 2020 versus 2019 as a result of lock-downs due to
the pandemic.
2. We expect an increase in theft and property related crimes in 2020 versus 2019 as a
result of economic hardship caused by the pandemic.
3. We expect an increase in hate crimes against Asian citizens in 2020 versus 2019 due to
an increase in anti-China rhetoric during the pandemic.


Through this project, we will:

- Explore the data
- Perform the needed data wrangling and manipulation
- Analyze and visualize the data
- Examine our different Hypotheses

The project includes two files:

- Project_2_Hanan.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook containing the code (Python)
- Final Report - NYC Crime (Hamilton-Moglia-Sukenik).pdf - The written report


Enjoy!
